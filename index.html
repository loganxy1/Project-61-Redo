            My favorite thing about fortnite is fishing. It really is the best! When players fish in forntite, good weapons can be found and fish that have capabilities of healing, or giving a boost to players for something. An example of that is the Hop Flopper. The Hop Flopper gives you health and increases your jumps' gravity to moon so that players can jump to a bit further places and deal damage from above. Another fish is the spicy fish, the most common of that one is the molten spicy fish and these fishes increases your speed like peppers do, causing steam out players' ears. Some fish are and can be used as weapons like the cuddle fish. The cuddle fish is a proximity which only explodes when stepped on. The bomb inks players' srceens for a few seconds. The other fish is the Stink flopper, a blob fish which can be used as a healing item for 40 health, or as a stink bomb when thrown!

        PRIMAL INTRODUCTION
    </h3>

            The pulse across the island erased all advance technology, making this season the primal season. The talk of primal for this season is like survival as the wildreness takes over and the island is filled with a primal biome. Meaning the map is morely farms and villages, improving civilication and places improving civilication with ruins are places like Boney Burbs and Colossal Crops. The pulse of the zero point went into six directions for the six of the seven. At the end of each directions of the primal biome are small spire towers with guardians at the to-be spots for the rest of the seven.

            <br>
            The main excitement and suprise with this wilderness is that it has brought wildlife! Fortnite has released wildlife for the first time with animals such as wild boars, chickens, frogs, and packs of wolves lurking in thick forest parts of the island. The animals drop meat and bones which both can be used for crafting. When players are in wolf attacks, two will strick and three others will be lurking around, to soon be encountered later in the match. Both boars and wolves drop two meat pieces and two bone peices.
            chickens on the other hand, only drop one bone and meat piece because of their size.

        <p>
            Crafting for fortnite is brand new and awesome! Vaulted weapons, at least used to be weapons, can be crafted with materials like the pump shotgun, a fan favorite and my personal favorite. For a pump shotgun, 4 metal resources would be required and 4 metal resources are required to craft any original guns. For primal weapons, four bones are used for each weapon and bones drop from wildlife when eliminated. The weapons to craft from can only be crafted from makeshoft weapons. There are makeshift shotguns, makeshift rifles, makeshift bows, makeshift smgs, and makeshift revolvers. The weapons can be crafted primal or original for those weapons. For week 1 in the season, crafting was big on the quests so make sure you know how to craft!
